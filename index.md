## About this Site

This project is meant to help students and researchers across University of Rochester create their
  own hosted academic website for free with GitHub. 

It's based off of NCSU Libraries' [jekyll academic](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/workshop/).


## Creating Your Own

To see a step-by-step guide to build your own site, go to the [research](/research) section. 
  There you'll find a basic ['Getting Started' guide](/blog/getting-started) that will help you
  create your new site, and a more [advanced tutorial](/blog/make-it-yours) showing you how
  to customize it.
