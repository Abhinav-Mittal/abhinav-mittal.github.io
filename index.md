This project is meant to help students and researchers across University of Rochester create their
  own hosted academic website for free with GitHub. 

## About this Site

This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by 
  [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/).
  The original project, called [`jekyll academic`](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/)
  has its own [github repository](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/jekyll-academic)
  and [workshop documentation](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/workshop/). 


## Creating Your Own

To see a step-by-step guide to build your own site, go to the [research](/research) section. 
  There you'll find a basic ['Getting Started' guide](/blog/getting-started) that will help you
  create your new site.
  
## Customizing Your Site

We also have a more [advanced tutorial](/blog/make-it-yours) showing you how to customize your 
  copy with different colors, pages, content, and more.
